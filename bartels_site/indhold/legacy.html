    <h1>The Bartels Design Legacy</h1>
    <h2>Everlasting and beautiful, Danish designs throughout four generations</h2>

    <h1>The Legacy timeline</h1>






    <div class="grid_legacy">
        <div>
            <p>The Danish shoe brand, Bartels since 1920, was first established under the name 'Bartels Damernes Sko' 
                by Louie
                and
                Emma Bartels. During the WWI, Emma and Louie moved from Germany to Denmark with the dream of starting up
                their
                own shoe
                factory founded on high quality, comfort, and impeccable craftsmanship, all wrapped in beautiful
                designs. In
                their
                apartment in Sommerstedsgade in Copenhagen, Bartels since 1920 took its first steps onto the timeless
                designs
                that still
                prevail today.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>In the 1920's, Bartels Damernes Sko took off, and the brand quickly became known for its feminine and
                delicate
                design.
                The production grew with rapid pace, so the apartment was replaced by a larger factory beaming with
                life.
                The
                shoes were
                designed by the Bartels, and in order to produce shoes of the highest quality, skilled Italian
                shoemakers
                traveled from
                Italy up to the factory in Copenhagen to share their extensive knowledge, and handcrafted each pair of
                shoes.
                From this
                on, the perfect fusion of Danish design and Italian craft was created - a fusion that still exists in
                the
                Bartels as you
                see them today.</p>

        <div>
            <p>In the glorious 1960's Bartels Damernes Sko was in its absolute prime. The designs were immensely
                popular, and
                renowned
                celebrities such as iconic Marguerite Viby all favored Bartels for its delicate lines and premium
                comfort. The
                shoes
                were sold at reputable stores like Magasin du Nord, Illum, and Fonnesbech in Denmark, and famous Macy's
                in New
                York.Bartels had truly become a high quality brand within danish design, and during this time, Bartels
                was also
                chosen
                to represent European shoe design in America - a tremendous honor for the small Bartels family.</p>

        <div>
            <p>In the pulsing 80's, Bartels Damernes Sko was led by Eva's father and aunt, who were the third generation
                of
                Bartels
                shoemakers. It was during this time that Eva's dream of becoming part of the family business was
                ignited, as
                most of her
                childhood was spent at the family factory, playing in-between piles of shoeboxes and materials. In the
                1980's
                the
                Bartels shoe production stopped for a period,and became a showroom for shoe import.Bartels Damernes Sko
                stayed
                dormant
                until it was revived by its fourth generation in 2017 - namely Eva.</p>

    <h2>1981</h2>





    <h2>2017</h2>

    <p>Today, Bartels is steered by Eva Bartels, the great-granddaughter of Louie and Emma Bartels. The love for shoes
        has
        always flown through Eva's veins. With a degree in shoe craft from Milan, numerous years spent on industry
        research, and
        learning the family business in and out, Eva revived Bartels Damernes Sko in 2017 as Bartels since 1920 - but
        with her
        own, unique twist. With a curious mindset that creatively plays with modern nostalgia, Eva blends the original
        Bartels
        designs with new, precious materials. Now, Eva has launched three Bartels since 1920 models, and in time, it is
        her aim
        to have a finite collection of 7 models, which will represent all the essential types of shoes that a woman
        should have
        in her wardrobe.</p>
