    <h2>From Italy con amore</h2>

    <p>Ever since the birth of Bartels since 1920, our love for Italy has been an integral part of our designs. For
        almost 100
        years, the shoes have been handcrafted by Italian shoemakers in order to have the highest level of quality and
        comfort.
        Today, Eva Bartels continues the family love legacy with frequent travels to Italy, always on the hunt for new
        Bartels
        designs and fabrics.Â </p>

    <h2>La fabbrica</h2>

    <p>After years of researching, our Bartels shoes are produced by a small, family-owned shoe factory with four
        shoemakers in
        a quaint village close to Bologna. Here, every Bartels shoe is meticulously crafted by hand, and as their
        speciality is
        within bridal shoes and textiles, you will often find Eva at the factory - curiously testing new ideas and
        patterns.</p>

    <h2>Slow fashion</h2>

    <p>At Bartels we have always believed in timeless designs over fast, seasonal fashion trends. For this reason,
        Bartels
        since 1920 creates small, few-of-a-kind collections crafted with love and respect for people and planet. The
        precious
        materials that we use are often found in limited amounts. This allows us to avoid overstocking and waste, and -
        most
        importantly - developing our shoe collections in an organic, thoughtful way.</p>
